# SwiftAlgorithms
This algorithm is written in swift. The main goal of this algorithm is to redistribute the array in such a way that all string object should have same value.
ex. word array = ["aabc","aaabc","aabc"]
Steps -: 1. Initialise array of integer contains 26 values and initialise all objects to zero.  
2. Iterate outer for loop.
2. Add inner for loop to iterate through all the characters of object of Array.
3. Calculate the index of character and store it in array.
4. Iterate through for loop and check if count of all character of string is equal to the array count.
5. If number of character occured in each word is equal to the array count then redistribution is possible else not.
